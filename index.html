                <p>One thing I am thankful for is getting the chance to travel around the world. Visiting places like Mexico, Korea, China, Japan and more, learning. Learning about all the different cultures and customs has been a dream.</p>

                <p>
                    One of my favorite holidays has to be Halloween. It is so much fun to dress up and get free candy. I enjoy creating my halloween costumes by using whats in my closet. I made the Olaf costume you see above, a skeleton costume, a devil costume and a minnie mouse costume. </p>
